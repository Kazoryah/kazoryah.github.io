- The best model to simulate light is reflected in a formula called the
**rendering equation**
([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation), scientific articles
 [1](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-radiosity-method-for-non-diffuse-environments-Immel-Cohen/8ff431442f137f9826bd94246270bfd786df2bbd)
 [2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-rendering-equation-Kajiya/0c75ad5dadb4ba3146826d322805795add692311)).

- The most important quantity in this equation is the radiance
- The radiant flux is the measure of the total amount of energy, emitted by a
light source, expressed in Watts. Associated letter: $\phi$
- Any light source emits energy, and the amount of emitted energy is function of
the wavelength

- Solid angle: It's a way to measure how large an object appears to an observer
looking from a point
- Radiant Intensity: is the amount of flux per solid angle
- Irradiance: we are interested in all the incoming light into a
point, that is the sum of all the radiance that hit a hemisphere centred on the
point itself

# BRDF

- Function that tells how much of the incoming ray contributes to the outgoing
one; its output, a weight mus be at maximum 1 to respect the law of conservation
of energy

# Cook-Torrance BRDF

- Microfacet model: assume rough surfaces can be modelled as a collection of
small microfacets

- Diffuse lighting with Lambert model

- Specular lighting with Cook-Torrance model
    - Divided in three main parts: **D**istribution function, **F**resnel
    function and **G**eometry function:
    - D: used to describe the orientation of the micro facets at some given
    point, the distribution function is called the [**GGX**](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Microfacet-Models-for-Refraction-through-Rough-Walter-Marschner/3ea24847bf20f94e79c55a166a8aaf6cb3feae1e)
